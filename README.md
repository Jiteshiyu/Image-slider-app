## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://snapslide.netlify.app/).

## Features

- View a collection of images with smooth transitions.
- Navigate through images using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- Responsive design suitable for various screen sizes.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the UI and component-based architecture.
- Vite: For fast development and optimized build processes.
- JavaScript/JSX: For the functionality and structure of the app.
- CSS: For styling and layout.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. If not, download them [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Snapslide.git
   cd Snapslide
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build.

## How It Works

The Image Slider App is a simple, responsive application built using React components.

Here's how the core functionality works:

1. State Management: The `Slider` component manages the index of the currently displayed image using the `useState` hook.
2. Image Transitions: When the user clicks the "Next" or "Previous" buttons, the index is updated, and the corresponding image is displayed.
3. Modular Components: The app is divided into modular components like `ImageSlider` for displaying images and `Controls` for navigation.

## Future Improvements

- Add animation transitions between images for a smoother experience.
- Include swipe gestures for better mobile usability.
- Display image captions or descriptions below each image.
- Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance.

## Challenges and Learnings

- State Management: Managing and updating state efficiently using React's `useState` hook was essential for smooth transitions.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the app works across different screen sizes and resolutions required careful attention to CSS.
- Image Indexing: Implementing a circular image indexing system so the user can infinitely cycle through images, even at the start or end of the list.
