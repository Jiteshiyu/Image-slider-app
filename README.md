   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/Snapslide.git
   cd Snapslide
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

- App.jsx: The main component that renders the `Slider` component.
- Slider.jsx: Manages image state and handles next/previous image functionality.
- ImageSlider.jsx: Displays the current image.
- Controls.jsx: Provides "Next" and "Previous" buttons for image navigation.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build.

## How It Works

The Image Slider App is a simple, responsive application built using React components. Here's how the core functionality works:

1. State Management: The `Slider` component manages the index of the currently displayed image using the `useState` hook.
2. Image Transitions: When the user clicks the "Next" or "Previous" buttons, the index is updated, and the corresponding image is displayed.
3. Modular Components: The app is divided into modular components like `ImageSlider` for displaying images and `Controls` for navigation, making the codebase easy to maintain and scale.

## Future Improvements

- Add animation transitions between images for a smoother experience.
- Include swipe gestures for better mobile usability.
- Display image captions or descriptions below each image.
- Implement lazy loading for images to improve performance.

## Challenges and Learnings

- State Management: Managing and updating state efficiently using React's `useState` hook was essential for smooth transitions.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the app works across different screen sizes and resolutions required careful attention to CSS.
- Image Indexing: Implementing a circular image indexing system so the user can infinitely cycle through images, even at the start or end of the list.
